# Check it App

This is my second project in CodeClan. It consists in an Android native application developed using Java and the built-in android SQlite database.

The app is intended to help users managing and taking quick notes of recommendations that friends would give them regarding any topics of interests that the users might have. It allows users to assign deadlines to their recommendations, add and delete categories to these, and filter content based on the them.
